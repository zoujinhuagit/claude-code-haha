//  THE input injection engine for the native Computer Use helper.

//  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//  ABSOLUTE RULE — read before touching anything in this file:
//
//    Every mouse/keyboard event is delivered with `CGEvent.postToPid(_:)`
//    (the Swift veneer over `CGEventPostToPid`). We NEVER call
//    `CGEvent.post(tap: .cghidEventTap)` / `CGEventPost(.cghidEventTap, …)`,
//    and we NEVER call `CGWarpMouseCursorPosition` /
//    `CGDisplayMoveCursorToPoint` / any `NSEvent` mouse-warp.
//
//    Moving the one real system cursor is precisely the bug this rewrite
//    removes: the user must keep their physical mouse free at all times.
//    The visible "cursor" the AI drives is the VirtualCursor overlay window
//    (see VirtualCursor.swift); the real OS cursor is never touched here.
//
//    Mouse events still carry a `mouseCursorPosition` — but that is only the
//    *event location* stamped on the synthetic event so the receiving app
//    hit-tests the right control. Posting an event to a pid with a location
//    does NOT move the hardware cursor; only an explicit warp would.
//  ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
//  TCC reality: real cross-app clicks/typing require Accessibility permission
//  granted to THIS signed binary in System Settings ▸ Privacy & Security ▸
//  Accessibility. `ensurePostable` enforces `AXIsProcessTrusted()` before
//  posting to any pid other than our own (self-posting is allowed untrusted so
//  the daemon/CLI self-test can validate the CGEvent construction + postToPid
//  path without any grant). When not trusted we throw `CUError("not_trusted")`,
//  which the bridge surfaces verbatim.
//
//  Coordinate contract: every (x, y) arriving here is ALREADY a logical
//  top-left point in the global display space (the TS layer scaled it). We use
//  the values verbatim — no scaleFactor, no flip, no warp.
