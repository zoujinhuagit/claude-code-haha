/**
 * Shared token-accounting rules for activity stats.
 *
 * Two independent code paths compute these stats — the local index reducer and the direct
 * transcript scan in `stats.ts` — and a parity test pins them to identical output. Rules that
 * decide what counts (deduplication, validity, working time, dollars) therefore live here rather
 * than being implemented twice and drifting apart.
 *
 * ## Cost estimation
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT reuse `calculateUSDCost()` from the CLI: that helper falls back to the
 * default model's rates for anything it doesn't recognize and fires an analytics event per call.
 * cc-haha is a multi-provider client, so a third-party model (glm, k3, deepseek, grok, gpt, ...)
 * priced at Claude rates would report wildly wrong dollars, and indexing runs this tens of
 * thousands of times per rebuild. Here an unknown model returns `null` instead — callers keep its
 * tokens in the activity totals but leave it out of the cost total, matching how ccusage and
 * openusage refuse to mix measured tokens with unpriceable ones.
 *
 * Rates come from `src/utils/modelCost.ts` so the dollar figures live in exactly one place; only
 * the model -> tier mapping is maintained here, because the CLI's canonical-name resolver pulls in
 * runtime state (settings, bootstrap) that has no business running inside the indexer.
