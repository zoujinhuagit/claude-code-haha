# Multi-Agent Usage Guide

Let Open AI Ma Zai orchestrate multiple specialized agents to handle complex tasks in parallel.

![Multi-Agent System Overview](./images/01-agent-overview.png)

## What Is the Multi-Agent System?

Open AI Ma Zai's multi-agent system is an **intelligent task orchestration framework** that enables the primary agent to spawn multiple specialized subagents, each executing different tasks independently, then aggregating results for the user.

Core philosophy: **Break large tasks into specialized subtasks, execute them in parallel, and boost efficiency.**

| Scenario | Traditional Approach | Multi-Agent Approach |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| Research 5 module architectures | Explore them one by one | 5 Explore agents scan in parallel |
| Implement + Test + Document | Complete sequentially | Team members each handle one part |
| Code review | Single-threaded, file by file | Multiple reviewers in parallel |
| Debug a complex bug | Try one hypothesis at a time | Multiple debuggers verify in parallel |

## Six Built-in Agents

![Six Built-in Agents](./images/02-agent-types.png)

Open AI Ma Zai ships with 6 specialized agent types, each with a specific tool pool and intended use case:

### general-purpose (General Agent)

**Use case**: Complex multi-step research, code search, tasks requiring full tool access.

```
Agent({
  description: "Research auth module",
  prompt: "Analyze all files under src/auth/ for the authentication flow...",
  subagent_type: "general-purpose"
})
```

- **Tool pool**: All tools (`*`)
- **Model**: Inherited from parent
- **Characteristics**: The all-rounder — choose this when you are unsure which agent type to use

### Explore (Exploration Agent)

**Use case**: Quickly search files, find code patterns, answer questions about codebase structure.

```
Agent({
  description: "Search API endpoints",
  prompt: "Find all REST API endpoint definitions...",
  subagent_type: "Explore"
})
```

- **Tool pool**: Every tool except Agent, ExitPlanMode, Edit, Write, and NotebookEdit. **Bash is in that set** — it cannot change files, but it can run any command
- **Model**: Haiku (fast, low cost)
- **Characteristics**: Cannot modify files; fast; ideal for research

### Plan (Planning Agent)

**Use case**: Design implementation plans, analyze architectural trade-offs, generate step-by-step plans.

```
Agent({
  description: "Plan refactoring",
  prompt: "Design a plan to split the monolith into microservices...",
  subagent_type: "Plan"
})
```

- **Tool pool**: Same denylist as Explore
- **Model**: Inherited from parent (requires strong reasoning)
- **Characteristics**: Outputs structured plans including key files and dependency analysis

### verification (Verification Agent)

**Use case**: Independently verify that an implementation is correct, run tests, perform boundary checks.

```
Agent({
  description: "Verify login feature",
  prompt: "Verify the newly implemented login feature works correctly...",
  subagent_type: "verification"
})
```

- **Tool pool**: Same as Explore; its system prompt additionally allows writing throwaway test scripts under tmp
- **Model**: Inherited from parent
- **Characteristics**: Always runs in the background; outputs PASS/FAIL/PARTIAL verdicts; displayed with a red badge

### claude-code-guide (Guide Agent)

**Use case**: Answer questions about Open AI Ma Zai, Agent SDK, or the Claude API.

```
Agent({
  description: "Query Claude API usage",
  prompt: "How do I use the tool_use feature...",
  subagent_type: "claude-code-guide"
})
```

- **Tool pool**: Glob, Grep, Read, WebFetch, WebSearch (internal builds swap in Bash for Glob/Grep)
- **Model**: Haiku
- **Characteristics**: Focused on documentation queries; uses the dontAsk permission mode

### statusline-setup (Status Bar Configuration Agent)

**Use case**: Configure the Open AI Ma Zai status bar display.

- **Tool pool**: Read + Edit only
- **Model**: Sonnet
- **Characteristics**: Highly specialized with an extremely narrow scope

### Agent Type Comparison

| Agent | Access | Tool Pool | Model | Purpose |
|-------|--------|-----------|-------|---------|
| general-purpose | Read/Write | All | Inherited | General tasks |
| Explore | No file edits | All tools minus the edit set | Haiku | Quick exploration |
| Plan | No file edits | Same as Explore | Inherited | Architecture planning |
| verification | No project-file edits | Same as Explore | Inherited | Independent verification |
| claude-code-guide | Read-only | Search + Web | Haiku | Documentation guide |
| statusline-setup | Read/Write | Read + Edit | Sonnet | Status bar config |

## How to Spawn Agents

### Parameters

The Agent tool accepts the following parameters:

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `description` | string | Yes | 3-5 word task summary |
| `prompt` | string | Yes | Full task description |
| `subagent_type` | string | No | Agent type (see table above) |
| `model` | string | No | Model override: sonnet/opus/haiku |
| `run_in_background` | boolean | No | Whether to run in background |
| `name` | string | No | Name the agent so it can be addressed via SendMessage |
| `team_name` | string | No | Join a specified team |
| `mode` | string | No | Permission mode |
| `isolation` | string | No | Isolation mode: worktree |

### Foreground Synchronous Execution (Default)

The simplest usage — the agent completes and returns its result:

```
Agent({
  description: "Analyze error logs",
  prompt: "Read the latest error logs under logs/ and summarize common error patterns"
})
```

The primary agent waits for the subagent to finish, then receives the result and continues working.

### Background Asynchronous Execution

Suitable for time-consuming tasks where the primary agent can continue with other work:

```
Agent({
  description: "Full code review",
  prompt: "Review all TypeScript files under src/ for code quality...",
  run_in_background: true
})
```

- The agent immediately returns an `async_launched` status with a taskId
- The primary agent continues working without waiting
- When the agent completes, a `<task-notification>` is delivered automatically
- The notification includes task status, output file path, and a result summary

### Spawning Multiple Agents in Parallel

Spawn multiple independent agents in a single message for true parallelism:

```
// Launch 3 explore agents simultaneously
Agent({ description: "Explore frontend", prompt: "...", subagent_type: "Explore", run_in_background: true })
Agent({ description: "Explore backend", prompt: "...", subagent_type: "Explore", run_in_background: true })
Agent({ description: "Explore database", prompt: "...", subagent_type: "Explore", run_in_background: true })
```

### Worktree Isolation

Let an agent work in an isolated git worktree without affecting the main workspace:

```
Agent({
  description: "Experimental refactor",
  prompt: "Try refactoring module X into...",
  isolation: "worktree"
})
```

- Automatically creates a git worktree (on an independent branch)
- The agent can freely modify files in the isolated environment
- If changes were made, returns the worktree path and branch name on completion
- If no changes were made, cleans up automatically

## Background Task Management

![Agent Spawn Flow](./images/03-spawn-flow.png)

### Task States

Background agents have four possible states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `running` | Currently executing |
| `completed` | Finished successfully |
| `failed` | Execution failed |
| `killed` | Manually terminated |

### Progress Tracking

Background agent progress updates in real time:

- **Token usage**: Input/output token counts
- **Tool usage**: Number of tools invoked
- **Recent activity**: Descriptions of the last 5 tool calls (circular buffer)
- **Last activity time**: Used to detect stuck tasks

### Completion Notifications

When a background agent finishes, the primary agent receives an XML-formatted notification:

```xml
<task-notification>
  <task-id>abc123</task-id>
  <status>completed</status>
  <summary>Agent "Explore frontend" completed</summary>
  <output-file>~/.claude/temp/.../tasks/abc123.output</output-file>
</task-notification>
```

### Automatic Backgrounding

When the `tengu_auto_background_agents` feature flag is enabled, foreground agents that run for more than **120 seconds** are automatically moved to background execution, freeing the primary agent to continue working.

## Agent Teams — Multi-Agent Collaboration

![Agent Teams Collaboration](./images/04-agent-teams.png)

Agent Teams is an advanced multi-agent collaboration mode where multiple agents work as a team, coordinating tasks through message-based communication.

### Creating a Team

```
TeamCreate({
  team_name: "feature-team",
  description: "Develop user authentication feature"
})
```

After team creation:
- A team configuration file is generated: `~/.claude/teams/{team_name}/config.json`
- A shared task directory is created: `~/.claude/tasks/{team_name}/`
- The current agent automatically becomes the **Team Lead**

### Adding Team Members

Spawn teammates by specifying `name` and `team_name` in the Agent tool:

```
Agent({
  description: "Frontend development",
  prompt: "Implement the login page React components...",
  name: "frontend-dev",
  team_name: "feature-team"
})

Agent({
  description: "Backend development",
  prompt: "Implement the authentication API endpoints...",
  name: "backend-dev",
  team_name: "feature-team"
})
```

### Teammate Communication

Send messages using the SendMessage tool:

```
// Send to a specific teammate
SendMessage({
  to: "frontend-dev",
  message: "API interface is ready, the format is...",
  summary: "Notify API interface format"
})

// Broadcast to all teammates
SendMessage({
  to: "*",
  message: "Everyone pause, requirements have changed...",
  summary: "Broadcast requirements change"
})
```

### Shutdown Coordination

When the task is complete, the Team Lead requests teammates to shut down:

```
// 1. Send shutdown request
SendMessage({
  to: "frontend-dev",
  message: { type: "shutdown_request", reason: "Task completed" }
})

// 2. Teammate responds with approval
SendMessage({
  to: "team-lead",
  message: { type: "shutdown_response", request_id: "...", approve: true }
})

// 3. After all teammates shut down, clean up the team
TeamDelete()
```

### Execution Backends

Agent Teams supports two execution backends:

| Backend | Description | Use Case |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| **in-process** | Runs in the same process, isolated via AsyncLocalStorage | Default mode; lightweight and efficient |
| **tmux** | Runs in a separate tmux pane | When an independent terminal view is needed |
| **iTerm2** | Runs in a separate iTerm2 window | For macOS iTerm2 users |

## Custom Agents

In addition to built-in agents, you can create your own specialized agents.

### Desktop Management and Scopes

In the desktop app, open **Settings → Agents**. The desktop app and CLI use the same Agent definition files; the configuration is not duplicated in a database or `localStorage`:

| Scope | Single source of truth | Use |
|-------|------------------------|-----|
| **User** | `~/.claude/agents/*.md` | Available in every project |
| **Project** | `<project-directory>/.claude/agents/*.md` | Available only in the current project; overrides a user Agent with the same name |

User and project Agents can be created, edited, and deleted from the desktop app, and saving writes directly to the corresponding Markdown file. Other sources, including built-in Agents, plugins, managed policy, and CLI arguments, also appear in the list but are read-only because the desktop app does not own their source files. Built-in Agents are one exception: their model and reasoning effort can be overridden individually, but the override lives in settings.json rather than in a source file and `source` stays `built-in`. See "Overriding a Built-in Agent's Model and Effort" below.

When the desktop app is connected to the active session, creating, editing, or deleting an Agent hot-reloads that session in place, so the next spawn uses the new definition immediately. If no runtime is available or the reload fails, the file is still saved; the desktop app shows a non-blocking warning, and the saved definition is loaded on the next launch.

### Definition Format

Create a `.md` file in the user or project `agents` directory:

```markdown
---
name: code-reviewer
description: Professional code review agent
tools:
  - Read
  - Grep
  - Glob
  - Bash
model: sonnet
effort: high
permissionMode: dontAsk
maxTurns: 10
---

You are a professional code reviewer. Check the following aspects:

1. Code quality and readability
2. Potential security vulnerabilities
3. Performance issues
4. Adherence to best practices
```

### Configurable Fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Agent type name |
| `description` | string | Description of when to use this agent |
| `tools` | string[] | Allowed tool list (`['*']` for all) |
| `disallowedTools` | string[] | Disallowed tool list |
| `model` | string | Model to use (`fable`/`opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku`, a full model ID, or `inherit`) |
| `effort` | string | Reasoning effort (`low`/`medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max`), subject to model capabilities |
| `permissionMode` | string | Permission mode |
| `maxTurns` | number | Maximum conversation turns |
| `mcpServers` | object[] | Required MCP servers |
| `hooks` | object | Agent-specific hooks |
| `color` | string | Display color used for the Agent |
| `skills` | string[] | Available skills |
| `memory` | string | Memory scope (user/project/local) |
| `isolation` | string | Isolation mode (worktree/remote) |
| `background` | boolean | Whether to run in background by default |

### Model, Reasoning Effort, and Thinking

To inherit from the current session, the clearest form is to **omit the corresponding field**: omit `model` to inherit the primary conversation model, and omit `effort` to inherit the current session effort. `model: inherit` is the equivalent explicit spelling for the model field; `effort` has no `inherit` value.

Model resolution uses this precedence, from highest to lowest:

1. A concrete model in `CLAUDE_CODE_SUBAGENT_MODEL` (`inherit` does not pin the model)
2. The model supplied to this `Agent({ ..., model: "..." })` call
3. `model` in the Agent Markdown frontmatter
4. `model` from `builtInAgentOverrides` in settings.json (built-in Agents only)
5. The primary conversation model

Reasoning effort resolution uses this precedence, from highest to lowest:

1. `CLAUDE_CODE_EFFORT_LEVEL`
2. `effort` in the Agent Markdown frontmatter
3. `effort` from `builtInAgentOverrides` in settings.json (built-in Agents only)
4. The current session effort
5. The model default

### Overriding a Built-in Agent's Model and Effort

Built-in Agents have no Markdown file, so their `model` and `effort` are adjusted through `builtInAgentOverrides` in settings.json. Keys are the agentType used to spawn them, and are case-sensitive:

```json
{
  "builtInAgentOverrides": {
    "Explore": { "model": "sonnet", "effort": "low" },
    "general-purpose": { "effort": "high" }
  }
}
```

A few rules that are easy to get wrong:

- **Only these two fields are writable.** The system prompt, tool scope, and color still come from the built-in definition, and the override does not change `source` — so a built-in Agent keeps its built-in tool privileges.
- **Clearing an override means deleting the field**, not writing `inherit`. Built-in defaults differ per agent (`Explore` defaults to `haiku`, `Plan` to `inherit`, and `general-purpose` omits `model`), so `model: "inherit"` is a normal value meaning "follow the primary session" — distinct from "restore the default".
- **Unknown agentTypes are ignored but never pruned.** The built-in set varies with feature flags and entrypoint, so automatic cleanup would destroy a valid configuration whenever a flag flipped.
- When the managed `strictPluginOnlyCustomization` policy includes `agents`, user- and project-level overrides are ignored **at load time**, and only managed sources apply.
- As with Agent Markdown files, editing settings.json does not affect an already-running session. The desktop app triggers a session reload when it saves; editing the file by hand requires restarting the session or `/reload-plugins`.

For the desktop entry point, see [Subagents and Task Splitting](../desktop/agents.md).

The `Agent` tool has no per-call `effort` parameter, so set it in the Agent definition or at the session level. Availability of `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, and `max` depends on the resolved model and provider capabilities. Claude models fall back to a lower supported level, other providers normalize through their model catalogs, and models without effort support do not apply the field.

Integer `effort` values remain only for compatibility with existing SDK/JSON and internal configurations; they are not a recommended official Agent configuration. The desktop Agent manager writes only the five named levels above.

Subagents normally inherit the primary session's extended-thinking setting, but requirements of the resolved model take precedence; for example, Fable 5 is normalized to adaptive thinking. Per-Agent `thinking` and `thinkingBudget` frontmatter are not supported, and `effort` is not a fixed thinking-token budget.

### Same-Name Source Priority

When several sources define an Agent with the same name, cc-haha selects the active definition in this order, from highest to lowest:

1. **Policy Agents** (policy) — Organization-managed policy
2. **CLI argument Agents** (flag) — Registered with `--agents`
3. **Project Agents** (project) — `<project-directory>/.claude/agents/`
4. **User Agents** (user) — `~/.claude/agents/`
5. **Plugin Agents** (plugin) — Supplied by plugins
6. **Built-in Agents** (built-in) — System predefined

The desktop app still shows overridden definitions and their sources, but spawning uses the highest-priority active definition.

## Permission Modes

Each agent can be configured with a different permission mode:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `default` | Normal permission requests requiring user confirmation |
| `plan` | All operations require explicit approval |
| `acceptEdits` | File edits are auto-approved; other operations require confirmation |
| `bypassPermissions` | Skip all permission checks |
| `dontAsk` | Reject all operations not pre-approved |
| `auto` | AI-driven permission classification (Anthropic internal only) |
| `bubble` | Permission prompts bubble up to the parent agent's terminal |
