# IM Integrations

A session running in the Desktop app can be reached from a private chat on your phone. Once bound, a message in Feishu, Telegram, WeChat, DingTalk, WhatsApp, WeCom, QQ, or Slack drives the Open AI Ma Zai session on your own machine: start a long task before you leave, then follow the progress, approve permissions, and switch projects from the road.

The chat partner is a bot or account you bound yourself. Messages reach your local Desktop app; no intermediate service holds your code.

## What you get

- **The same session, continued.** Messages sent from your phone enter the Open AI Ma Zai session on your computer, where file edits, commands, and reads really happen.
- **Resume history.** `/sessions` lists history in the current project; `/sessions <project name or absolute path>` opens another project. Use `/resume <number>` to continue, including sessions created on Desktop.
- **Project switching.** `/projects` lists recent projects and switches to the one you pick; `/new` starts a fresh session.
- **Permission approval.** When Claude wants to write a file or run a risky command, the request is pushed to the chat. Feishu and DingTalk send interactive cards, Telegram sends buttons, and every other platform expects a text reply.
- **Status and stop.** `/status` reports the current project, model, and run state; `/stop` interrupts the current turn.

The Desktop app has to stay running. The chat side is only a remote control.

## Choosing a platform

All eight expose the same capabilities. They differ in setup cost and approval experience.

| Platform | How you connect | Best for | Known limits |
|---|---|---|---|
| Feishu | Scan a QR code in Settings; the bot is created and its credentials stored for you | Teams that want one-tap permission approval | Private (`p2p`) chats only; menu changes require publishing a new app version |
| Telegram | Ask `@BotFather` for a Bot Token, paste it into Settings | Individuals who can reach Telegram; fastest setup | Private chats only |
| WeChat | Scan a QR code in Settings to log in a bot account | People who only want WeChat | Private chats only; permission approval is text replies |
| DingTalk | Scan a QR code in Settings; credentials are filled in for you | Organizations already on DingTalk | Private chats only; interactive approval cards need an extra template ID |
| WhatsApp | Scan from **Linked devices** on your phone | Users outside mainland China | Personal linked-device login, not the official Cloud API; personal private chats only |
| WeCom | Scan a QR code in Settings to create an AI bot | Organizations on Enterprise WeChat | Private chats only; permission approval is text replies |
| QQ | Scan a QR code in Settings; credentials are filled in for you | Individuals on QQ | Private (C2C) chats only, no groups or guilds; text approval |
| Slack | Create the app from a pre-filled manifest, paste two tokens | Teams on Slack | Direct messages only; no QR flow, tokens are pasted by hand |

If you have no preference, start with Telegram or Feishu — their approval flows are the most comfortable.

## Pairing flow

Binding happens in two layers: first the Desktop app gets platform credentials, then your personal account is authorized with a pairing code. The second layer is identical everywhere.

1. Open **Settings → IM Adapters**.
2. Bind one platform in its tab: Feishu, WeChat, DingTalk, WhatsApp, WeCom, and QQ use a QR code; Telegram and Slack take credentials.
3. Pick a directory under **Default Project**.
4. Select **Save**.
5. Back at the top, in **Pairing**, select **Generate Code** to get a six-character code.
6. Send that code to your bot in a private chat on the matching platform.
7. Once pairing is confirmed, anything you type goes to Open AI Ma Zai.

A code is valid for 60 minutes, works once, and is invalidated the moment a new one is generated. The code itself is platform-neutral — it binds whichever account sends it. Five failed attempts within five minutes trigger rate limiting.

Generating a code and QR binding are written to local configuration immediately. **Save** is only needed for typed values such as App ID, Bot Token, **Allowed Users**, and **Default Project**.

Paired accounts appear under **Paired Users**, where **Unbind** revokes one of them. A revoked user needs a fresh code.

## Default project decides where work happens

**Default Project** is the working directory for new IM sessions. With it set, the first message from your phone opens a session in that directory. Left empty, the bot lists recent projects and asks you to choose.

Later messages in the same chat reuse that session, and the mapping survives a Desktop restart. `/new` changes the directory; `/clear` empties the context while keeping the project binding.

## Find an old session from your phone

Send `/sessions` to list history for your current project. Without a session binding, it starts with a project picker. Use `/sessions projects` to choose a different project, or `/sessions <project name or absolute path>` to open one directly. Ambiguous names show a list to choose from.

Each page shows eight sessions with their title, update time, message count, and a marker for the current session. Reply with a number shown on that page or send `/resume <number>` to continue the selected conversation. Use `/sessions next` and `/sessions prev` to turn pages. Accessible worktree sessions are grouped under their project and resume in their original working directory.

Browsing preserves the current binding. `/cancel` exits selection; ordinary chat text also leaves the history picker and continues your current conversation. Lists expire after 15 minutes. Finish pending approvals or send `/stop` and wait for the current turn to stop before switching. If a session was deleted, its directory is unavailable, or connecting fails, the original binding is retained.

Telegram also keeps its `/resume` project and session button menu. The text commands above work on all platforms.

## Allowed project directories decide which projects it can touch

**Default Project** only decides where new sessions start — it is **not** the access boundary. The real boundary is **Allowed project directories**: the bot can only list, open, and start sessions in projects inside those directories, which constrains `/projects`, `/sessions`, and picking a project by name or absolute path.

Leaving it empty means the default: your home directory (plus the default project, if it is outside home). Most people never need to change it. To narrow it to a few directories, add them to the list in Settings.

The configuration lives in `~/.claude/adapters.json`, and each platform can be narrowed on its own:

```json
{
  "allowedProjectRoots": ["~/work", "~/side"],
  "whatsapp": { "allowedProjectRoots": ["~/work/sandbox"] }
}
```

A per-platform setting **replaces** (does not add to) the global one: in the config above, WhatsApp can only touch `~/work/sandbox`, while every other platform gets `~/work` and `~/side`. The Settings UI edits the global copy, so once a platform is configured separately, changes made there no longer affect it.

Running an adapter standalone (without the Desktop app) also accepts the `ADAPTER_ALLOWED_PROJECT_ROOTS` environment variable, with directories separated by the platform path delimiter (`:` on macOS / Linux, `;` on Windows). This environment variable outranks both file layers.

A few boundary rules:

- A directory must be an existing absolute path (`~` is expanded). Paths that do not exist are ignored and logged; if none resolve, the default is used rather than locking the bot out.
- The default never inherits roots such as `/` or `/Users`. When the Desktop app is launched as a GUI, the sidecar's working directory is `/`, and taking that as the boundary is the same as having none.
- If **Default Project** falls outside the allowed set, a new session starts in the first allowed directory and a line is logged — so `/new` does not fail when the two settings disagree.

Pairing is still the first gate: an unpaired sender cannot issue commands at all, and this directory list is a second line of defense on top of it. Note that the home directory also contains sensitive paths like `~/.claude` and `~/.ssh`; for stronger isolation, narrow the list to specific project directories.

## Common commands

Entry points differ slightly per platform — Feishu can expose commands as a bot menu — but these work everywhere:

- `/help` — list available commands
- `/status` — current project, model, and run state
- `/projects` — list recent projects and switch
- `/new` — start a new session, optionally with a project number or path
- `/sessions [project]` — list old sessions; `/sessions projects` chooses another project
- `/resume <number>` — continue a session from the list
- `/cancel` — exit selection and keep the current session
- `/clear` — clear context, keep the project binding
- `/stop` — stop the current generation

Feishu, WeChat, DingTalk, WeCom, QQ, and Slack also accept Chinese aliases such as `帮助`, `状态`, `项目列表`, `新会话`, `清空`, and `停止`.

## Security

::: warning This is a remote control for your computer
A paired account can make Claude read files, write files, and run commands on your machine. Send pairing codes only to yourself, never post one in a group, and never commit bot credentials.
:::

Authorization is the union of **Allowed Users** and paired users. When both are empty, every sender is rejected. Binding a bot or a linked account does not authorize its contacts.

Platform credentials, pairing state, and allowlists live in `~/.claude/adapters.json`; chat-to-session mappings live in `~/.claude/adapter-sessions.json`. Both stay on your machine, both contain material that can drive it, and neither should be shared. Sensitive fields are masked when the settings page reads the configuration back. Both paths follow `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when a custom data directory is active.

For a full mobile interface rather than a chat window, see [H5 access](../desktop/remote.md).
